Colin Summers is a BS/MS student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering and is advised by Prof. Siddhartha Srinivasa. He is primarily interested in algorithms that enable intelligent machines to acquire general notions of intelligence in order to robustly solve complex and temporally-extended tasks in real-world settings.

Colin works to design and implement performant control and perception algorithms that enable realtime autonomous operation of MuSHR. He also helps wrangle the growing MuSHR software ecosystem.
