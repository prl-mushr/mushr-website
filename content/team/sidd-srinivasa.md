Siddhartha Srinivasa is the Boeing Endowed Professor at The Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, and an IEEE Fellow. He is a full-stack roboticist, with the goal of enabling robots to perform complex manipulation tasks under uncertainty and clutter, with and around people. To this end, he founded the Personal Robotics Lab in 2005. He was a PI on the Quality of Life Technologies NSF ERC, DARPA ARM-S and the DARPA Robotics Challenge, has built several robots (HERB, ADA, CHIMP), and has written software frameworks (OpenRAVE, DART) and best-paper award winning algorithms (CBiRRT, CHOMP, BIT\*, Legibility) used extensively by roboticists around the world. 

Sidd started the MuSHR program in 2017 at UW with the goal of democratizing robotics by providing an open-source low-cost full-stack robotics platform for education and research. He created the first  undergraduate Robotics class at UW in 2017 that used the race car platform, and the overwhelmingly positive response to the class inspired the team to make MuSHR a reality.
