Fereshteh Sadeghi is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington working with Prof. Siddhartha Srinivasa. She completed her PhD at University of Washington where she worked on domain invariant vision-based policy learning for robotics. Her research is focused on developing learning algorithms that combine perception and control for learning robot skills. 

Fereshteh is interested in how learning can be used to enable machines acquire behavioral skills that can generalize to unstructured real world settings. During her PhD, she developed techniques for learning highly generalizable vision-based robot controllers in simulation for efficient transfer and adaptability to the real world. Fereshteh is a former NVIDIA Graduate Research Fellow.
