### Introduction
The MuSHr car operates in a mapped area to determine its position, orientation, and plans. We can create 
custom 2D maps for our cars by using [ROS's gmapping](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping) and our car's laser scanner to 
survey the area to be mapped.
### Goal
Create a custom map of an area by driving the car to survey the surroundings.
### Requirements
  - Complete the [quickstart](/tutorials/quickstart) tutorial
  - Complete the [Intro to Ros](/tutorials/intro-to-ros) tutorial  

### Install gmapping

### Start the car and gmapping

### Save the map
