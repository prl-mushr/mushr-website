      <p>There is a large barrier to entry to working with robots. They require extensive knowledge of hardware, software, and algorithms. In addition, they are very expensive. The goal of MuSHR is to address this barrier by democratizing robotics. We want anyone from high school students to P.h.D. researchers to learn and produce research in robotics. Specifically, we are seeking to lower the barriers to entry for robotics in both cost and skill. We are pursuing these goals by building low cost racecar platforms, open source software, and learning materials like tutorials and class assignments. This wiki serves as the primary informational resource for the MuSHR project.</p>
